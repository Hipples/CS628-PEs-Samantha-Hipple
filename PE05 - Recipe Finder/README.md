**Objectives:**
- Create a React app with navigation using React Router.
- Develop a full-stack application using Node, Express, and MongoDB Atlas.

**Features:**
1. **Recipe List**: Implement a route displaying a list of recipes with each as a clickable link navigating to its details.
2. **Add Recipe**: Implement a route allowing users to add a new recipe (name, ingredients, instructions, etc.).
