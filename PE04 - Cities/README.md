The Cities Web App is a React application that allows users to view, add, and get details about cities. 

# INPUT 
The app mainly receives input from two sources:

1. **User Input**: The `AddCity` component is responsible for capturing user input. Users can enter information about a city, including its name, country, and population, through an HTML form.

2. **State Variables**: The main state variable is `cities`, which is an array that stores the list of cities added by the user. It is managed by the `useState` hook in the `App` component.

# PROCESS
The main processing occurs in the `App` component:

1. **Add City**: When the user submits the form in the `AddCity` component, the `addCity` function is triggered, which updates the `cities` state by appending the new city data.

2. **Routing**: The app uses React Router's `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, and `Route` components to handle the navigation between different views. There are two main routes, `/` and `/add-city`, which correspond to the `Cities` and `AddCity` components, respectively. The `CityDetails` component is nested under the `/cities/:id` route to display details of a selected city.

# OUTPUT
The output is displayed in three main components:

1. **Header**: The `Header` component displays a static header with the title of the app.

2. **Cities**: This component displays a list of cities stored in the `cities` state. Each city is a link that, when clicked, navigates to the `CityDetails` component to show more information about the city. If no cities have been added, it displays a message indicating that there are no cities.

3. **AddCity**: This component displays a form that allows users to add a new city. Upon successful submission, the user is redirected to the `Cities` view.

4. **CityDetails**: This component displays detailed information about a city when a user clicks on a city name from the `Cities` component.

In summary, the app takes input from the user and the `cities` state, processes it by adding new cities and handling navigation, and outputs it through various components that display the cities' list, details, and a form for adding new cities.
